accurate automated detection of WMH is very challenging due to the high variability of their characteristics both between and withinsubjects.exampleat the populationlevelthe amount and distribution of white matter lesions have been associated with various factors such as cognitionvascular risk factors and neurodegenerative diseases.WMH also occur more commonly at older ageet al.the subjectlevelgenerally WMH exhibit spatial heterogeneity and do not appear with the same contrast in all regions of the brain on structural MRI images.exampletypicallyperiventricular WMH are brighter on T2weightedFLAIR or proton density images and bigger compared to deep ones and hence can be detected more easily.variability in lesion characteristics can affect the performance of supervised lesion segmentation methods at different stages.esti mation of the probability for each voxel to be lesionlesion probability mapis affected by populationlevel factorssuch as agecognitionvascular risk factors and pathological conditionset al.et al.and lesion loadet al.lesion probability map is generatedthe choice of the threshold used to obtain binary maps is affected by lesion load and the variation in local intensities.factheterogeneity in signal intensity affects lesion probability values determined by segmentation algorithms since brighter lesions are typically assigned higher probabilities than those with lower contrast.makes it difcult to determine the optimal threshold for obtaining thenal binary lesion maps.factapplying global thresholdi.the same threshold to all the voxels of the lesion probability maptypically results either in the exclusion of deep lesions or overestimation of peri ventricular lesions.often results in tradeoff between sensitivity and specicity of lesion detection.alternative proposed byet al.consists of determining thresholds based onscore or by visual inspection of individual subjects.these thresholds would also be global and determining them would require manual intervention.this workour objective is to improve our recently developed WMH segmentation methodAbNormalitycationrithm to overcome population and subjectlevel variability in the lesion characteristics.aim to achieve this by systematically exploring ways of improving various stages of the lesion probability map estimationand also by developing method for thresholding that takes into account spatial variability of lesion proba bility map

the estimation of lesion probability mapwe tested the inclusion of populationlevel lesion probabilities with respect to para metric factor and explored the performance of alter native machine learning methods.way to include populationlevel probabilities is to obtain the distribution of lesions within population with respect to parametric factor and use it in BIANCA as either spatial prior or an additional feature in the WMH segmentation.this workwe modelled the spatial distribution of lesions within population with respect to age to obtain apopulationlevel parametric lesion probability map as described in our previous study and explored whether the information provided by the PPLPM could improve the results orconverselyintroduce bias towards the expected distributionrefer toof populationlevel parametric lesion probability mapand corresponding results).the alternative machine learning techniqueswe explored four other supervised classiers used in the existing literature and compared their segmentation results with those obtained from the existingneighbour classication algorithm in BIANCArefer toof alternative classiers within BIANCA and results).networks support vector machines and adaboost classier have been already used for WMH segmentationwhile random forests have been used for the segmentation of various structures and pathological signs that have similar characteristics as WMH on structural MR imageset al.to improve the thresholding stagewe propose LOCATE supervised method to determine optimal local thresholds for binarising the subjectlevel lesion probability map to take into account the spatial heterogeneity in lesion probabilities.LOCATE is guided by local probability values and exploits different lesion characteristics to determine local thresholds.this work we present LOCATE with specic applicability to BIANCAhoweverin principle LOCATE can be applied to the lesion probability map obtained by any methodprovided the availability of training data with manual lesion masks.evaluated LOCATE on various clinical datasetsneurodegenerative cohort and vascular cohortand publicly available WMH segmentation challenge datasetto observe the performance of LOCATE on data acquired under different protocolsand later applied it on two additional datasets to further explore the potential of LOCATE toprovide relevant local thresholds for different lesion loadsdistribution and patternsrefer toLOCallyand corresponding results).shows the block diagram describing the strategies explored for improving BIANCA performance.this work we usedve datasets to study the effect of variations in lesion characteristics on the WMH segmentation.datasets are diverse in terms of populationand therefore WMH load and characteristics.neurodegenerative cohortis subset of the same dataset we used in our previous work to optimise BIANCA subjects with manual lesion segmentation available lesion load rangemmmedianmm.ythe dataset includes MRI data from subjects with probableswith amnestic mild cognitive impairment and cognitively healthy control subjects recruited from the OPTIMA study and from theat theinage range yearsmean age.MRI images were acquired at theofOCMR centre onscanner using T2weighteduid attenuated inversion recovery research sequenceTR/TE msip angle FOV mmmatrix sizeCvoxel size mmand highresolution T1weighted images were also acquiredTR/TE.vascular cohortvascular studydataset consists of consecutive eligible participants in the OXVASC study who had recently experienced minor nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attackage range yearsmean age.NeuroImagebrain volume rangemmmedianmm.was performed at theonscanner using T2weightedFLAIR sequenceTR/TE msip angle FOV mmmatrix sizeCvoxel size mmand high resolution T1weighted sequenceD MPRAGE sequenceTR/TE.lesion segmentation was available for all imageslesion load rangemmmedianmm.cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy cohortdataset consists of patients with CADASILage range yearsmean age

is because PPLPM indicates the likelihood ofnding lesion at given location in populationinformed primarily by the anatomy of disease signs.the other handthe subjectlevel probability map reects the probability of identifying lesion versus the normal tissue and is pri marily determined by the intensity contrasts and noise in the image.instancein our previous work we showed that in PPLPM the lesion probabilities typically increase more in the peri ventricular WM than in the deep WM in the elder populationwhich is in line with the existing literatureet al.et al.postmultiplying the PPLPM with the subjectlevel lesion probability map can bias the subjectlevel lesion probabilities more towards the periventricular lesionsirrespective of the local spatial characteristics in the images from the individual subject.results of LOCATE for lowmediumhigh and very high lesion load.segmentation is shown along with outputs of global thresholding at.LOCATE provides better segmentatio in deep and periventricular white matter lesions when compared to global thresholding.NeuroImage when we provide the PPLPM as an additional featurethe classier assigns sensible lesion probability values taking into account the PPLPM as well as the image intensity contrasts for the different modalities and the spatial coordinates.we observed that adding agespecic map as an additional feature gives better results than the average mapsince the former models the lesion probabilities for the subjects age group specically and hence is more accurate.we observed thatat presentusing the PPLPM does not improve signicantly the performance of BIANCAalso evident from the pvalues of our ttest results).our current recommendation is that PPLPMwith age as parameter of interestis not necessary for improving BIANCA segmentation.the way this option will be implemented in future release of BIANCA is quiteexible and will allow the user to use anyD PPLPM with respect to any other factor of interestwhich could improve the segmentation in their specic dataset.it is worth noting that before using this optionthe user needs to ensure if the demographics of the test dataset are comparable to those of the population used to model the PPLPM.results on the comparison between KNN and other classiers showed that KNN provided better segmentation.the same set of features we observed that SVM and AB classiers provided signicantly lower SI than KNNespecially at higher thresholds.the other handSI values for RF and NN followed similar trend to KNN with relatively similar SI values.the NDGEN datasetSI values for RF were still signicantly lower than KNNwhile NN gave SI values that were not signicantly different from KNN.the MWSC datasetSI values obtained using KNN did not differ signicantly from those of RF in all cohorts and from those of NN in the VUcohort.for given FPRKNN has higher TPR compared to any other classier,indicating that KNN detects more true lesions than other classiers

since NN and RF have the potential to perform as well as KNNthey will be included as alternative classiers in future release of BIANCA.this pointit is worth noting that irrespective of the classier usedthere is certain degree of uncertainty associated with the manual segmentation they are an approximation to the real ground truthmeaning that veryne discrimination may reect errors in the manual segmentation rather than errors in the automated classication results.the improvements at the thresholding step with LOCATEthe initial leaveonesubjectout results of LOCATE on NDGENOXVASC and MWSC datasets showed improvement in BIANCA segmentation for all datasets.LOCATE detected more true positive lesionsespecially in the deep white matterand provided better delineation of the lesions with respect to the manual segmentation as indicated by the improved SI values and the visual results shown in.BIANCA is currently not optimised for segmentation of corticalcerebellar and subcortical lesionswe could not further evaluate LOCATE perfor mance in these areassince they are not included in BIANCA output.LOCATE provided results comparable with global thresholdirre spective of changes in the acquisition protocols and image characteristics in MWSC dataset.ranking methods for MICCAI WMH segmentation challenge are based onandet al.et al.and modied location sensitive deep convolutional neural network.nlincluding SI values and clusterwise true positive rateof individual lesions).achieved an average SI value of.we achieved clusterwise true positive rate of.results of BIANCA with locate and global thresholding compared to the manual segmentation.corresponding thre shold maps are shown in redyellow.NeuroImage.of ROC curvesSI plots for LOCATE and global thresholding.ROC curves SI indices for NDGENOXVASC and MWSCVUNUHSUMCdatasets.NeuroImage.of clusterwise true positive rates in periventricular and deep region for LOCATE and global thresholding.true positive ates in periventricular and deep regions shown for NDGENOXVASC and MWSC datasets

NeuroImage methods achieved.LOCATE gives better clusterwise TPR when compared to global threshold and the third ranking method in the challenge.direct comparison would not be possible since the results of the top ranking methods were determined on the independent test datasetswhile our results were obtained on leaveoneout validation on the MWSC training datasets that are publicly available.we retained the regions corresponding to other pathologies for more stringent evaluationwhile these regionswere ignored during evaluation in the MICCAI challenge.validation of LOCATE on CADASIL and HC datasets proves that LOCATE is robust with respect to variations in lesion load and location without the need to retrain both BIANCA and LOCATE.factLOCATE can be trained on any data having the same modalitiesacquired with the same sequence to the test dataset.instancewe used the OXVASC dataset to train LOCATE for testing it on the CADASIL dataset since both datasets were acquired with the same sequences.pattern of lesionsTablestatistics and ANOVA results for comparison of clusterwise TPR values for global threshold of.NDGEN OXVASC VUNUHSUMCstatisticsregion LOCATE.results of LOCATE on the CADASIL data.FLAIR imageglobal thresholding at.that the threshold maps shows the heterogeneity in the lesion proba bilities in various regions of the white matter.NeuroImage CADASIL subjects differs from that of vascular subjects in the OXVASC datasetas CADASIL subjectsin addition to the normal distri bution of WMH seen in SVDwill typically have lesions within the external capsule and anterior temporal lobes.to this variability in lesion characteristics and patterntraining BIANCA on the OXVASC dataset yields very low lesion probabilities in the tem poral regions.ecting these lower lesion probabilitiesthe thresholds map from LOCATE shows much lower threshold valuesespe cially in the temporal regions in the CADASIL images.LOCATE yields much better segmentation performance compared to global threshold of.LOCATE results on CADASIL showed substantial increase of.indicates that LOCATE takes into account different lesion patterns and hence can be used in different pa thologies.compared with the approaches proposed byet al.LOCATE overcomes the need for manually determining thresh olds for individual subjects on the CADASIL datasetwhile still providing similar SI values and comparable limits of agreement with the gold standard on BlandAltman plot

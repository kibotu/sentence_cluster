might also support an overestimation of the predicted lesion volumes.should also be acknowledged that our cohort has very low proportion of subjects with large WMHand even these lesions are comparably small to the extensive conﬂuent lesions found in pronounced small vessel disease.we cannot excludethat diﬀerent compositions of training setsthat include subjects with far bigger lesi on volumesaregenerallyinferiorinthepredictionofstudysampl es that comprise small WMH.we might deduce that balanced training setcontaining low as well as higher lesion subjectsyields the most accuratepredictionresults,atleastregardingvolumetric overlap.orget al.WMHin BIANCAwe speculatethat representative training sample including all the range of possible WMH volumes might be optimal.as these analyses are posthocthis hypothesisremainshighlyspeculative.limiting factors of our analysis were the availability of training data and computation time.manually delineated white matter hyperintensity masksderived from MR sequences acquired with the same scannerrepresent high number in theeld of population studiesit is at the lower end of the scale in machinelearning.higher number of random training sets would enhance the reliab ility of ourndingsbut would take very long time to delineate manuallyand also increase computational time to about year or longer.with the limited number of subjects to draw fromchances are increased to get duplicate training sets.we checked for thatand we were not able to identify an identical set.associated limitation is the.the accuracymean absolute error of the diﬀerence between BIANCA prediction and manually delineated masksof the models does not signiﬁcantly improve from training size of about onwardwe do observe increasing robustness,.decreasing chance of drawing deviating model with an increasing number of training participants.we cannot exclude the possibilitythat with further increase in trai ning sample size the performanceparticularly the robustnesswou ld still proﬁt.in our cohorttraining sample siz of manually labeled imageswhich from cost beneﬁt viewshouldbe realizableinmost studieswas adequa tely robust,.none of the models showed an extreme deviation from the meant.we do not have inter or intrarater agreement measures for our manual delineations.intent ion of our manual masks was to gain the most possible validity of WMH masks

reproducibility will surely be important for the BIANCA algorithm to reliably work in large cohortour primary quality goal for the manuals mask was validity.way to yield the most valid masks was by consensus decisions,i.theharmonizationofratingsbyconstantl yhaving two raters to evaluate each image as well as conducting case based expert consensus meetings.designthis maximizati on of validity was at the cost of potential intra or interrater agreementcomparisons.AbNormality Classiﬁcationlik other toolsonly gives recommendations but does not oﬀer fully standardized pipeline for image preprocessing.construction and validation of pipeline for brainextracti on and biascorrection can be timeconsuming.open solutionsbeginning with the inpu of data in standardized speciﬁcation format such as BIDS and containerized environment for preprocessing and analysi might help to standardize these approaches in the future.tested only the recommended default settings for BIANCA and evaluated the inﬂuence of the training sample size.the authors of BIANCA also developed locally adaptive thresholding method to determine the ideal local threshold for the white matter hyperintensity probability maps instead of applying global threshold.thismethodshowedthebestimprovement in the prediction of WMH when applied to cohorts with higher lesionload.CONCLUSIONAbNormality Classiﬁcationis frequently used algorithm for automated white matter hyperintensity segmentation.study highlights the importance of choosing representative training sample of suﬃcient size for cohorts with low average lesion volumes.his increases the chance of training model that is close to the groundtruthandreﬂectsthelesionpropertiesinthepopulation.further work is needed to evaluate the transfer on other cohortsparticularly cohorts comprising very low as well as very high lesion volumes.study is also needed to elucidate and ideally improve the inaccurate lesion predicti on forsmallWMH.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENTraw data supporting the.

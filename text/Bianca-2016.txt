in the post processing step if the proportion of neighbours belonging to the WMH class exceeds certain threshold,and if the voxel is located in the white matterthe voxel is classied as WMH.of training dataset WMHs of subjects ofand subjects ofwere manually segmented on FLAIR imagesproducing binary masks with the value of or.manual segmenta tion was achieved through consensus among three trained operators who also had access to T1w images for subjects in.of manual masks for the two datasets are shown inplementary.manually segmented masks were used both to train BIANCA and to judge its performance by comparing BIANCA output and the manual masks in leaveoneout testssee BIANCA optimisation for details).avoid biased resultsand to be able to also test the accuracy of BIANCA in segmenting the WMH for the subjects in cluded in the training datasetBIANCA automatically applies the leave oneout crossvalidation methodreduced training set is used for the segmentation of subject from the training datasetwhere the reduced training set excludes this subject and is built from the voxels of the re maining training subjects.BIANCA optionssection describes the different options that are currently available in BIANCA and have been tested in this work.shows schematic representation of the options and the set of values/parame ters tested.BIANCA can include any set of MRI modalities from eitherD orD acquisitionsfrom which the intensity features are extracted.BIANCA works with images in the subject's spacebut they need to be registered to consistent reference MRI modality.BIANCA isﬂexible also in terms of reference modalityand the choice could de pendfor exampleon the image quality and the aim of the studyTim ages are usually the ones with the highest resolutionwhile FLAIR images are the ones with highest contrast for WMH and usually usedto create the manual masksbut have lower resolution.this study we decided to use Timages as reference for the main analyses onto avoid downsampling it when registering it to the FLAIR imagehoweverwe tested subset of options also in FLAIR spacesee supplementary material for details).between the two mo dalities were performed using FLIRTet al.andwith trilinear interpolationthe manual masks was thresholded at.normalization using variance scalinget al.is automatically applied by BIANCA to all images.BIANCA can also utilise spatial coordinatesformed by using linear registration tond each voxel's corresponding MNI coordinate.and colleagueset al.already demonstrated that information about the coordi nates of voxel increases the accuracy of the segmentationas in some regions of the brain WMH are more likely to occur than in others.spatial weighting option takes this further and applies linear scale factorafter the normalization of the feature vectorto the coordinate data within the feature vector

scaling provides way of emphasiz ing the role that the coordinates playwith higher value for spatial weighting leading to the neighbouring feature vectors being more likely to come from similar spatial locationseffec tively making the kNN method use more local training data.ap proach works because with high spatial weightingeven relatively small difference between two voxels in the MNI space will make them very far away from each other in the feature spaceand thereforeonly nearest neighbours with very similar spatial coordinates will be selected for the classication.sw the data is simply variance normalisedwhereas if sw the spatial coordinates will be ignoredand if sw becomes very large then the nearest neighbour.NeuroImage effectively ignore the intensity features and the output would become prior lesion probability mapbased purely on le sion locations in the training dataset.this option to be usedtransformation matrix from the subject space to standard MNI space is required.intensity featurescontaining the local average inten sity for each modalitycan also be included using thepatchoption.or more patch sizes can be chosenby setting the sizein voxelsof the square/cubic kernel used for local averaging.inclusion of intensity information about small neighbourhood of each voxel has been proposed beforeet al.in order to make the segmentation more robust to misregistra tion.patches used for local averaging with BIANCA can beD or3D.this study we testedD patch onandD patch ondue to the highly anisotropic voxels.calculating the local average for voxel on the border of the brain maskthe local aver aging is performed by averaging only the voxels within the kernel that are inside the brain mask.included in the training set.tested whether BIANCA's performance would change when changing the subjects used in the training dataset according to the amount of WMHsas judged by the visual ratings provided.compared three optionsusing all the subjects for which we had manual segmentation available using only those with the highest WMH load or using those with the lowest WMH load.all caseswhen running the segmentation.and brief description of the different options available with BIANCA tool and schematic representation of the different values tested in this study during the phase of algorithm optimisation.main text for further details.NeuroImage an image included in the training datasetBIANCA automatically ex cludes that subject from the training dataset.of nonWMH training points

the size of such datasets becoming larger and larger it is increasingly infeasible to perform segmentation manually and this makes the development and availability of automated tools urgently needed.BIANCA is currently not optimised for application on longitudi nal data.algorithm optimised for working on longitudinal data would require different approachwhich will be the objective for fu ture studies.limitation of our method is that BIANCA is not completely auto maticas it requires training dataset of manually segmented images when applied to data from other scanners or other acquisition protocols.manuallabelling step is time consuming and requires expertise in WMH identicationbut is necessary as the characteristics of FLAIR and Timages varies among scanners and pulsesequences.we demonstrated that we were able to reach good performance with only subjects.could still represent disadvantage for small studiesbut relatively negligible effort in large crosssectional studies with hundreds of subjectsas the ones mentioned above.showed that higher accuracy is achieved when using subjects with high WMH load as training subjectswhich are also the easiest to manually seg mentas the hyperintensities are more visible.will be important to test in future whether BIANCA can be trained on one dataset and.NeuroImage another dataset acquired with the same protocolfurther reducing manual intervention.would also make BIANCA applicable to multicentric studies.limitation is the necessity to use an exclusion mask of grey mattercerebellum and subcortical structures to decrease the amount of false positivesas typically FLAIR images present hyperintensities in cor tical areas andow artefacts around theth ventricle.BIANCA is currently not able to detect cortical and cerebellar abnormal ities.this study we excluded subjects with large vascular lesions or with neoplasticdevelopmental or inammatory abnormalitiesin order to specically focus on white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin.studies will focus on the seg mentation of other types of lesionsfor example multiple sclerosis lesions.limitation of this specic studywe did not optimise the value of kbut selected value of based on the literatureet al.and colleagues ed other values and showed that in the current range is suitable for this type of segmentation problemwithout the need to in crease andconsequentlythe processing time.we did not test all the possible congurations of the options available in BIANCAgiven the very large number of possibilities.we aimed to show the effect of varying the values of the single options on the perfor mance and to suggest twophase approach that can be used to opti mise BIANCA for any datasetas theexibility of the algorithm allows the user to test any possible combination.concludein this work we optimised and validated BIANCAan al gorithm for WMHs segmentation that isautomatedonly requiring time and expertise to manually seg ment small number of imageswith well identiable WMHsor capable of working with single modalityfrom ei therD orD acquisitionsallows the user to change many optionsnot only related to the MRI modalitiesto data acquired at different times from different scan nersas we tested it on two very different datasets in terms of scan nersequencesand subjectspathologyit shows good reproducibility withinscannerleanwith respect to existing methodsit showed similar or higher performance compared to other approaches already pro posed in the literature

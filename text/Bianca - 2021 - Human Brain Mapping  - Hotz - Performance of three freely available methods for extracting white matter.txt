matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular or igin are frequently found in MRIs of healthy older adults.WMH are also associated with aging and cognitive decline.we compared and validated three algorithms for WMH extraction: FreeSurfer UBO and FSL's  sity AbNormality  using longitu dinal dataset comprising MRI data of cogni tively healthy older adults .reference we manually segmented WMH in T1w, threedimensional FLAIR, and tw odimensional FLAIR images which were used to assess the segmentation acc uracy of the different automated algo rithms.we assessed the relationships of WMH volumes provided by the algorithms with scores and age.FreeSurfer underestimated the WMH vol umes and scored worst in  but its WMH volumes strongly correlated with the scores.BIANCA accom plished the highest DSC in 3D FLA IR images.the relations with the scores were only moderate, especially in the 2D FLAIR images and different WM lesion contrasts is clusterbased, fully automated pipeline that works without training dataset and, like BIANCA, relies on the kNN algorithm for quantifying WMH.was validated by the developers themselves,using two datasets —one crosssectional and the other longitudinal both with twodimensional FLAIR images.datasets included older participants with medical conditions such as stroke, transientischemic attack and so on.showed that UBO is reliable tool for WMH extraction and found strong WMH agreement compared with their manual reference.date, no further validationstudy of UBO has been published, but it was used for extracting WMH in three additional studies .estimate the accuracy of the automated WMH segmentations, we used fully manually segmented WMH as proxy for true WMH.refer to these manually segmented WMH as gold standards.our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the WMH segmentation performance of different methods and the influence of MR image modality using comprehensive longitudinal MRI data of cognitively healthy older adults collected in singlecenter study.our study we want to answer the following explicit questions:.of segmentation accuracy algorithm and MR image modality provides estimates that are most consistent with the respective gold standard in terms of:.established accuracy metrics and.using the whole dataset do the WMH volume esti mates provided by the different algorithms relate toa.the frequently used score and.used data from the first four measurement occasions.base line LHAB dataset includes data from participants.each mea surement occasion, participants ompleted an extensive battery of neuropsychological and psychom etric cognitive tests and under went brain imaging.criteria for study participation at base line were age years, righthandedness, fluent language proficiency, score of points on the   nation no selfreported neuro logical disease of the central nervous system and no contraindications to MRI.study was approved by the ethicalcommittee of the canton of.was voluntary andall participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the declaration of.the present analysis, we used participants with structural MRI data with sample size at baseline of and image modality.see S1 for an extended overview of the data structure and study design.the and on  for rules of use;

OA articles are governed by the applicable  estimates of UBO 2D and 3D FLAIR, while the corresponding correlation was clearly smaller for BIANCA.resultsare consistent with the recent study of et al.who also reported superior WMH segmentation accuracy of UBO compared with BIANCA.the WMH volumes of FreeSurfer correlated very highly with both UBO outputs but less strongly with volumes esti mates provided by BIANCA, which may be due to the outlier WMHsegmentations BIANCA produced.the other hand, the WMH vol umes extracted by FreeSurfer were generally smaller than the outputs of UBO and BIANCA.would like to emphasize thatFreeSurfer is the only algorithm that even underestimated its “own gold standard.WMH volume underestimation also affected the accuracy metrics which were signifi cantly worse for FreeSurfer compared with the other algorithms.and DER, BIANCA 3D FLAIR performed best.the flip side, BIANCA showed the weakest correlation with the scores, and the larges residual variances in the LMMs.line with thelatter, BIANCA 2D and 3D FLAIR had the highest number of outliers WMH volumes compared with the other algorithms, which can be clearly detected in the withinsubject trajectories.studies reportannual percentage increases in WMH volumes in the range between.summarized the progression rates of WMH volumes in serial MRI studies in their 2, showing wide variability of ranges.ourstudy, the annual WMH volume increases based on BIANCA's estima tions were clearly higher than the changes reported in the literature and they were alsohigher than the changes detected with UBO and FreeSurfer in this study which is likely also related to the outlier segmentations that influenced segmentation's reliability.acloser look on the segmentation variability of the algorithms by meansof the – plots, which illustrate data of the subsample used for the manual segmentation , we observed that the limits of agreement are wider in BIANCAthan in UBO.the 2D and 3D FLAIR image plots show strong outliers.in this subsample the single deviations in BIANCA's output seem to cancel each other out and result in mean WMH volume that is very sim ilar to the gold standard's WMH volume.analyzing the validation of the algorithms, we can conclude that with our subsets UBO and FreeSurfer T1w, as compared with BIANCA performed more robust and also more consis tently across time.research needs to evaluate if the segmentation errors BIANCA produced with our longitudinal dataset also occurin the context of other datasets.general problem in the context of automated WMH lesion segmentation using FLAIR images is the incorrect inclusion of the septum pellucidum, the area separating the two lateral ventricles, in the output masks.area appears hyperintense on FLAIR sequences,and therefore, looks very similar to WMH.erroneously detected as WMH, the septum pellucidum enters the output volumesas false positive region, which leads to an overestimation of the WMH volume.UBO developers also segmented the septum pellucidum in their gold standard.already fed their algorithm with this false positive information, it was to be expected that UBO would also segment the sep tum pellucidum in our data, which may have caused the worse DERcompared with FreeSurfer and BIANCA.we used fully manually seg mented gold standards in all three planes and for three different MR modalities by multiple operators, who reached excellent interoperator agree ments.the manual segmentations, our study features scores for the whole dataset, which were used to crossvalidate theWMH volumes provided by the segmentation algorithms.limitation of this study is that we applied the algorithms to only one sample and that this sample was homogeneous with respectto its low lesion load.studies should determine how well theseresults generalize to other studies, scanners, sequences, and heteroge neous datasets including clinical populations.FreeSurfer has not been specifically programmed for WMH detection, but is tool for extensive analysis of brain imaging data.of all the other parameters FreeSurfer outputs besides WMH volume, the processing time is very long.FreeSurfer output comprises the total WMH volume and the total nonWMH volumes.UBO has been specif ically programmed for WMH detection, and has been trained with “builtin ”training dataset.it is possible to train the algorithm using previ ously manually segmented gold standard.this procedure only works within the  in DARTEL space, and is very timeconsuming.output from UBO is wellstructured and contains among others theWMH volume and the number of clusters for total WMH,PVWMH, DWMH as well as WMH volumes per cerebral lobe.subset 2, the whole WMH extraction process took min per brain with the computing environment specified in the methods section.subset 3, the WMH nt k~ 2m np rb.the and on  for rules of use;
